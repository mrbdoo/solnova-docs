# 🎮 Core Game Components

## 1. Stars (The Foundation)
The Star is the heart of your system. It is the NFT you own. It provides gravity, light, and energy (SNOVA) to your planets.
*   **Role:** Energy Source, SNOVA Generator.
*   **Evolution:** Can be brightened (Burn to Shine) to unlock more planets.

## 2. Planets (The Canvas)
Planets revolve around your Star. They are your personal creative spaces.
*   **Customization:** You can apply textures and upload GIFs to your planets.
*   **Role:** Each planet holds **one Meme (GIF)**.
*   **Economy:** Active planets (with a GIF set) farm SNOVA.
*   **Relation:** Planets are naturally smaller than Stars. Bigger stars (Legendary) have proportionally bigger planets.

## 3. Memes / GIFs (The Content)
In the Neververse, GIFs are not just funny images; they are valuable entities, like **Pokemon**.
*   **Rarity:** GIFs are rare. You don't just "upload" anything; you collect them.
*   **Sources:**
    *   Your own uploads.
    *   Incoming Satellites (GIFs dropped by others).
    *   GIFs from planets you visited.
    *   Gods of the Day.
*   **Function:** They inhabit planets and can be sent as Satellites to other users.

## 4. Satellites (The Messengers) - *Season 2*
Satellites are the "glue" that connects far-flung star systems.
*   **What is it?** A flying object carrying a GIF and a short message (up to 140 chars).
*   **Mechanic:** You cannot keep a Satellite for yourself; you must **drop it** on someone else's planet.
*   **Lifespan:** Flies around the receiver's planet for 15 days, then remains in their collection.
*   **Benefit:** Boosts the host planet's SNOVA production.

A GOD is the ultimate expression of a Star's power.
*   **Requirement:** Can only be placed on a Star that has reached **100% Brightness**.
*   **Visual:** A HUGE GIF, the size of the Star itself, visible from far away in the galaxy.
*   **Status:** A symbol of dominance and completion.

## 6. Brands / Invaders (The Partners) - *Season 4*
Brands are "aliens" from the parallel universe (the Real World) invading the Neververse.
*   **Good & Bad:** Some cooperate, some compete.
*   **Portals:** Brands can place Portals on your planets (replacing GIFs) to host mini-games or campaigns.
*   **Nuggets:** Hidden prizes (real-world items like iPhones or Macs) hidden inside Satellites or scattered across the universe.
*   **Symbiosis:** Brands pay SNOVA and Real Prizes to interact with the user base.
