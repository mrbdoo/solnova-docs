## How to Get the Genesis NFT

On the Presale stage, each early investor will get **1 NFT of random Rarity** for each **10,000 SNOVA** bought (which is equivalent to **2.5 SOL**), but not more than **3 Free NFTs** in one hand.

## Exclusive Benefits:
1.  **x2 Default Farming Coefficient:** They farm SNOVA twice as fast as standard stars.
2.  **Central Area Position:** Located in the heart of the Neververse Galaxy.
3.  **Unique Visuals:** Distinctive gradient glow.
4.  **10-Year Farming Limit:** While later seasons have reduced farming limits, Genesis Stars can farm SNOVA for **120 months (10 years)**.
