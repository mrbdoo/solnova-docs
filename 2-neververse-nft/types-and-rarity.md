# ⭐ NFT Types & Rarity

The Neververse is populated by stars of different magnitudes. The rarity of your NFT determines the potential of your Star System.

## Seasonal Release Structure

The Neververse evolves in Seasons. Each season introduces new NFTs with different economics.

| Season | NFT Supply | Farming Limit (Months) | Full Price (SOL) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Presale (Genesis)** | 1,000 | **120** | - |
| **Season 1 (Big Bang)** | 5,000 | 15 | 2 |
| **Season 2** | 10,000 | 12 | 2.5 |
| **Season 3** | 20,000 | 9 | 3 |
| **Season 4 (Brands)** | 30,000 | 6 | 3.5 |
| **Brands Era** | 55,000 | 0 | 4 |

> [!WARNING]
> **Post-Farming Era:** New NFTs minted in the Post-Farming Era (Season 5+) will **not** have SNOVA farming ability. Their value will be derived entirely from Brand interactions (renting planets for Portals and Satellites for Nuggets).

> [!NOTE]
> **Common Rule Starting from Genesis NFTs:** NFTs that were not sold in one Season will be added to the batch of New NFTs of the next Season. There will still be a small chance to get earlier Season NFTs, even the Genesis ones, if there were any left unsold. This is good luck since earlier generations of NFTs have better Farming Limit rates.
