## Total Supply Logic (Why 2.2 Billion?)

The Total Emission is not arbitrary. It is calculated backwards from the **Vision**:
> *How much SNOVA do we need to service the system until it is fully populated (120,000 Stars) and ready for the Brands Era?*

We calculated the farming potential of every NFT across all 5 Seasons, assuming optimal play (Shining Up, Satellites).

### SNOVA Global Emission Calculation

| Season | NFT Count | Farming Limit | Total SNOVA Added to Emission |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Presale (Genesis)** | 1,000 | 120 Months | ~294,317,323 |
| **Season 1** | 5,000 | 15 Months | ~183,948,327 |
| **Season 2** | 10,000 | 12 Months | ~294,317,323 |
| **Season 3** | 20,000 | 9 Months | ~441,475,985 |
| **Season 4** | 30,000 | 6 Months | ~441,475,985 |
| **Season 5** | 55,000 | 0 Months | 0 |
| **TOTAL** | **121,000** | | **~1,655,534,943** |

*Note: The remaining supply covers liquidity provisioning, marketing incentives, and ecosystem buffers.*

## Deflationary Mechanics

SNOVA is constantly burned or removed from circulation:
1.  **Burn to Shine:** The massive cost to upgrade stars.
2.  **Ship Customization:** Buying skins.
3.  **Brand Era (The Flywheel):** Brands buy SNOVA from the market to pay for campaigns.

> [!TIP]
> **The Cycle:** Tokens burned during "Shine Up" or spent on Skins return to the System Reserve. We effectively resell them or burn them to manage price stability.
