## Understanding the Curve

The emission curve visualizes how SNOVA enters circulation over time:

*   **Presale & Season 1:** High emission rate (Big Bang phase)
*   **Seasons 2-4:** Gradual decrease as farming limits reduce
*   **Season 5:** Zero emission (Post-Farming Era begins)

This controlled emission ensures:
*   **Early Adopters:** Rewarded with higher farming potential
*   **Sustainability:** Gradual release prevents inflation
*   **Value Growth:** Scarcity increases as emission slows
