# Infographics Prompts for Nana Banana Pro

Here is a collection of detailed prompts to generate the essential visuals for the White Paper and GitBook.

## 1. The Star Rarity Spectrum
**Goal:** Show the visual progression of Star Types.
**Prompt:**
> Create a horizontal infographic showing 5 distinct 3D sci-fi stars in a dark cosmic void.
> 1. **Common Star:** Small, pale blue, simple spherical glow, 12 small spikes.
> 2. **Uncommon Star:** Slightly larger, green tint, brighter glow, 8 defined spikes.
> 3. **Rare Star:** Medium size, purple pulsing energy, complex geometry with 6 major beams.
> 4. **Epic Star:** Large, fiery orange, intense aura, 3 massive swirling arms.
> 5. **Legendary Star:** Massive, blinding white-gold core, complex fractal light rays, dominating the space.
> *Style:* Cyberpunk, neon, high contrast, clean 3D render.
> *Labels below stars:* Common (64%), Uncommon (25%), Rare (10%), Epic (9%), Legendary (1%).

## 2. The Genesis Star (Unique)
**Goal:** Highlight the special look of the first 1000 NFTs.
**Prompt:**
> A close-up cinematic shot of a single "Genesis" Star in deep space.
> *Features:* The star should have a unique multi-colored gradient glow (cyan to magenta to gold) unlike normal single-color stars. It looks ancient and powerful.
> *Context:* Situated in a dense, bright cluster of stars (the Galaxy Center).
> *Text Overlay:* "GENESIS: The First 1000".

## 3. Burn to Shine Mechanics
**Goal:** Explain the upgrading process.
**Prompt:**
> A 3-step evolution diagram of a single planet system.
> **Step 1 (Left):** A dim, small star with only 1 planet orbiting. Label: "30% Brightness". Icon of a SNOVA coin burning underneath.
> **Step 2 (Middle):** The star is bigger and brighter, 5 planets orbiting. Label: "60% Brightness". More SNOVA coins burning.
> **Step 3 (Right):** A massive, blindingly bright star with 15 planets orbiting in complex rings. A huge holographic "GOD" avatar floats above it. Label: "100% Brightness - x2 Yield".
> *Style:* Clean isometric or flat-3D vector style.

## 4. Satellite Interaction (The "Bee" Analogy)
**Goal:** Visualize the social sharing mechanic.
**Prompt:**
> A scene showing two planetary systems in the distance.
> A futuristic spaceship is flying from System A to System B.
> The ship is dropping a small, glowing mechanical satellite (resembling a drone with a message envelope icon) onto a planet in System B.
> *Visual Metaphor:* Faint glowing lines connecting the stars, like a web of connections.
> *Text Bubble:* "Dropping a Satellite + 140 char Message".

## 5. Brands Invasion (Web 3.0 + Web 2.0)
**Goal:** Show real-world brands entering the game.
**Prompt:**
> A split composition.
> *Left Side:* A digital 3D planet surface with a pixelated "Portal" door.
> *Right Side:* Real-world items (iPhone, MacBook, Sneaker Box) bursting out of the Portal.
> *Action:* A futuristic "Brand Spaceship" (sleek, corporate design) is beaming a "Campaign" signal down to the planet.
> *Text:* "Real Prizes in a Virtual World".

## 6. Tokenomics Emission Curve
**Goal:** Visualize the scarcity over time.
**Prompt:**
> A line chart infographic set against a dark space background.
> *X-Axis:* Seasons (Presale, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5).
> *Y-Axis:* SNOVA Emission Rate.
> *Curve:* Starts high and steep (Presale/S1), then gradually curves down (S2-S4) and hits a flat line at S5 (Post-Farming).
> *Annotations:*
> - At S1: "Big Bang"
> - At S4: "Brands Invasion"
> - At S5: "0 Emission / Circulation Only"
