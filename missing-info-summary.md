    *   Roadmap timeline visualization
    *   Team member photos

3.  **GitBook Configuration:** Ensure your GitBook is configured to:
    *   Show right-side navigation anchors (automatic with proper heading structure)
    *   Display images properly
    *   Support interactive components if needed

4.  **Content Review:** Before final publication:
    *   Proofread all content for typos
    *   Verify all numbers and calculations
    *   Ensure consistency in terminology
    *   Check all cross-references between sections
