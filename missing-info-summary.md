# Summary & Important Notes

This document summarizes the final structure of the White Paper and highlights areas where additional information or clarification might be needed to finalize the project.

## 🟢 Status
All chapters from the **Solnova (SNOVA) & Neververse Plan** have been successfully structured, formatted, and integrated into this GitBook folder. The tone has been adjusted to be friendly yet professional, as requested.

## 🟡 Missing Information / Gaps
To make this document 100% complete, consider adding the following details:

### 1. Technical Specifications
*   **Blockchain:** The text implies **Solana** (references to "SOL"), but it's not explicitly stated as the exclusive chain. Confirm if it's 100% Solana-based.
*   **Wallet Integration:** Which wallets will be supported? (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
*   **Smart Contracts:** A brief technical overview of the contract security (audits?) would add credibility.

### 2. Precise Formulas
*   **Farming Coefficients:** The document uses ranges (e.g., "1.2-1.4"). For the final "White Paper", you might want to publish the *exact* algorithm or keep it vague to prevent gaming the system. Currently, it's presented as "Random".
*   **Shine Up Cost:** The formula is tied to "3 months of farming". This is a dynamic value. Confirm if this is calculated *at the moment of burning* based on the *current* farming rate of the star.

### 3. Team & Partners
*   The "Team" is mentioned in Tokenomics, but there are no bios or names. Adding "Doxxed Team" info (if applicable) drastically increases investor trust.

### 4. Legal Disclaimers
*   Standard crypto "Risk Warning" and "Not Financial Advice" footers are highly recommended for the Introduction or a separate footer section.

## 🔵 Recommendations
1.  **Interactive Calculators:** The placeholders in the `Gameplay` and `Tokenomics` sections are critical. Ensure your web dev team implements these as actual React components or embedded widgets in the GitBook.
2.  **Visual Consistency:** Use the provided *Infographics Prompts* to generate a cohesive visual style. The "Neon/Cyberpunk" aesthetic fits the descriptions well.
3.  **Bilingual Support:** Since the source material was mixed (English/Russian), ensure you have a plan for a Russian translation if your target audience includes that region.
