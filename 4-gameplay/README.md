# Gameplay Mechanics

The Neververse is not a passive investment; it is a game of strategy, exploration, and social interaction.

## SNOVA Farming

The core economic loop is **Farming**. Your Star System generates SNOVA tokens based on its activity and development.

### Logic of Farming
The key component of farming is the **Planet**.
*   **Inactive Planet:** A planet without a GIF. Produces 0 SNOVA.
*   **Active Planet:** A planet with a GIF set. **It is actively farming SNOVA.**

### The Farming Formula
How much SNOVA does a Star generate?

> **MaxStarFarmingCapacity (SNOVA/h) =**
>
> `DefaultCapacity` × `StarFarmingCoeff` × `PlanetFarmingCoeff` × `ActivePlanets` × `BrightnessBoost` × `SatelliteBoost`

**Parameters:**
1.  **DefaultCapacity:** Base generation per planet (e.g., 1 SNOVA/hour).
2.  **StarFarmingCoeff:** Multiplier based on Star Rarity (Random, NFT-given).
3.  **PlanetFarmingCoeff:** Random efficiency coefficient for each planet.
4.  **ActivePlanets:** Number of open planets with GIFs.
5.  **BrightnessBoost:** **x2** when Star reaches 100% Brightness.
6.  **SatelliteBoost:** **x2** for a specific planet when it has 15 satellites orbiting it.

### Farming Impact Factors
*   **NFT-Given Rarity:** Higher rarity = Higher coefficients and more Max Planets.
*   **Strategy:** You can significantly increase yield by **Shining Up** (unlocking planets) and **Socializing** (attracting satellites).

## SNOVA Burning: "Burn to Shine"

To maximize your farming potential, you must upgrade your Star. This process is called **Shining Up**.

### Mechanics
*   **Cost:** You burn SNOVA tokens to increase your Star's Brightness.
*   **Effect:** **1 Boost step = 1 New Orbit (Planet) Opens.**
*   **Visuals:** Orbits start glowing, the Star grows physically larger, and new planets appear.

### The Price of Greatness
The cost to reach 100% Brightness is a constant designed for stability.
> **Price of 100% Brightness =** Equivalent to **3 Months** of Maximum Possible Farming for that specific Star.

*Logic:* You reinvest 3 months of potential earnings to permanently double your output (via the x2 Brightness Boost and unlocking all planets).

### 100% Brightness Privileges
Reaching the maximum brightness is the ultimate goal for a Star Owner:
1.  **All Planets Open:** Maximum farming slots available.
2.  **Full Brightness Boost:** **x2 Multiplier** to SNOVA production.
3.  **GOD Placement:** Ability to place a "GOD" (Huge GIF) on the Star.
4.  **Star Texture:** Ability to customize the Star's texture.
5.  **Brand Eligibility (Season 4):** Your star becomes eligible to host Brand Campaigns and earn extra rewards.
