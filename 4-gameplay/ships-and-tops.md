## User TOPs (Leaderboards)

Competition is a key driver of the Neververse. We track and celebrate the most active and successful players.

### Categories (Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly)
1.  **Top GODs:** The most popular and impressive 100% Bright Stars.
2.  **Top GIFs:** The most collected and shared memes.
3.  **Top Star:** The highest SNOVA production systems.

> Being in the TOPs isn't just for vanity; it attracts more visitors (Satellites), which in turn boosts your farming further. It's a positive feedback loop.
