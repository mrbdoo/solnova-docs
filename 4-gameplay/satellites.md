**Satellites are the glue that joins far-flung star owners together.**

In the vast emptiness of space, Satellites are the unique innovative way to connect. They turn the Neververse from a lonely single-player experience into a vibrant social network.

## Core of User-User Interaction: Sharing

We realized that if we create a platform where interaction is beneficial, innovation will follow.

> [!INFO]
> **CORE IDEA:** To earn more, everyone must help fill each other's planets.

### How Satellites Work
1.  **Delivery:** You fly your Ship to a foreign star system.
2.  **The Drop:** You "dump" a Satellite on one of their planets.
3.  **The Message:** Along with the Satellite, you leave a short message (up to 140 characters).
4.  **Notification:** The owner is notified of the incoming visitor and their coordinates.
5.  **Lifespan:** The Satellite orbits the receiver's planet for **15 Days**.
6.  **Aftermath:** After 15 days, it disappears from the orbit but remains forever in the receiver's "Collected Satellites" inventory.

> [!TIP]
> **Why do this?**
> *   **For the Sender:** It's a way to communicate, show off your rare GIFs, and attract visitors back to your system.
> *   **For the Receiver:** Incoming Satellites boost the planet's SNOVA farming. **15 Satellites on a planet = x2 Farming Boost.**

## GIFs are the New Pokemon

In this world, GIFs are not infinite. They are rare entities. You can't just spam them; you collect them.

**You can only drop a Satellite using a GIF you "own" in your inventory:**
1.  **Your Own:** GIFs you uploaded to your planets.
2.  **Incoming:** GIFs others dropped on your planets.
3.  **Visited:** GIFs from planets YOU dropped satellites on.
4.  **GODs:** Rare "God of the Day" GIFs.

**The "Flower and Bee" Strategy**
You act like a flower attracting Bees (other users).
*   By displaying cool, rare, or funny GIFs on your planets, you make your system a destination.
*   Users come to "collect" your GIF by dropping a Satellite on it.
*   In return, their Satellite boosts your farming.

## Emotional Connection
The limitation of dropping satellites only on *foreign* planets, combined with the physical need to fly there and the 140-character limit, creates a new, immersive format of communication. It's not a chatroom; it's a cosmic correspondence.
