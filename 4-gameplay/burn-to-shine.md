To maximize your farming potential, you must upgrade your Star. This process is called **Shining Up**.

## Mechanics
*   **Cost:** You burn SNOVA tokens to increase your Star's Brightness.
*   **Effect:** **1 Boost step = 1 New Orbit (Planet) Opens.**
*   **Visuals:** Orbits start glowing, the Star grows physically larger, and new planets appear.

## The Price of Greatness
The cost to reach 100% Brightness is a constant designed for stability.
> **Price of 100% Brightness =** Equivalent to **3 Months** of Maximum Possible Farming for that specific Star.

*Logic:* You reinvest 3 months of potential earnings to permanently double your output (via the x2 Brightness Boost and unlocking all planets).

## 100% Brightness Privileges
Reaching the maximum brightness is the ultimate goal for a Star Owner:
1.  **All Planets Open:** Maximum farming slots available.
2.  **Full Brightness Boost:** **x2 Multiplier** to SNOVA production.
3.  **GOD Placement:** Ability to place a "GOD" (Huge GIF) on the Star.
4.  **Star Texture:** Ability to customize the Star's texture.
5.  **Brand Eligibility (Season 4):** Your star becomes eligible to host Brand Campaigns and earn extra rewards.
