# 🚀 How the Platform Will Become Massive?

The obstacle before rapid platform development may become the lack of Brands joining the platform due to:
*   Not knowing about the platform
*   Not understanding the need of being presented there

These challenges can be fixed by:
*   Direct demand-driven sales to desired brands by the community
*   Most importantly, active attraction and stimulation of the community in Brand attraction
