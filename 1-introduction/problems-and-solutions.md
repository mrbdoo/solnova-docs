# 🔍 Problems and Solutions

The crypto and marketing landscapes face fundamental challenges that require innovative solutions. Solnova addresses these critical issues through a revolutionary Web 3.0 platform.

## Problem Type 1: New Tokens' Fundamental Flaws

### Lack of Real Utility
Most new tokens lack genuine utility and fail to provide sufficient value to holders. They exist as speculative assets without meaningful use cases or practical applications in the real world.

### No Capital Influx Mechanisms
There are no clear mechanisms to robustly supply constant influx of new capitalization while maintaining active token circulation within the system. Tokens often stagnate after initial hype, leading to declining value and engagement.

### No Long-Term Strategic Vision
Most tokens and their utilities lack long-term strategic sense. They focus on short-term gains without building sustainable ecosystems that can evolve and grow over time.

## Problem Type 2: Marketing Evolution & Gen Z

### Outdated Marketing Formats
Old marketing formats may not work effectively in 2026. Traditional advertising and engagement strategies are losing their effectiveness as consumer behavior evolves.

### Gen Z Needs New Interaction Formats
Gen Z requires new, bold formats of interaction. This generation has grown up with digital-native experiences and expects innovative, engaging ways to connect with brands and communities.

### Gen Z's Saving Behavior
Gen Z, more than any other generation, tends to save money due to multiple social and economic reasons. Traditional marketing approaches that rely on immediate spending don't align with their financial habits.
