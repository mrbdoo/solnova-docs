# 💭 Philosophy

We see Neververse as an innovative, unique digital space providing completely new formats of interaction—first between users, and subsequently between brands and users.

We built this universe on **4 Pillars**:

## 1. Creative Expression

We believe it is crucial that this space, this universe, is created by the users themselves. It is a living and constantly updating product of their joint creative expression.
*   **Memes as Planets inhabitants:** Star owners upload GIFs to their planets to make them farm SNOVA.
*   **Full Planet, Star and Ship Customization:** Textures, Skins, Boosts, you name it.

## 2. The Joy of Inter-User Interaction

*   **TAGS:** A possibility to find your people in this cosmos. By adding a GIF, you can also add a TAG. Searching by this tag allows you to fly through the Neververse, finding those passionate about the same things as you, and seeing how they expressed this love with available creative tools.
*   **Satellites:** Exchanging satellites is a form of helping each other (boosting planet SNOVA production x2), signs of attention, and more.
*   **New Formats:** Unexpected ways of interaction, for example, for dating or finding friends.

## 3. Dopamine Reactor

We want our platform to be a source of constant dopamine for the user:
*   Because it is a comfortable space with a beloved community and its own jokes.
*   Because it is a constant source of the unexpected—whether it's a satellite from another stranger or games across the universe from a brand.
*   Because it is a game, and rewards here are obtained either by chance or by competition and victory.
*   Because in this game, there are **REAL gifts** (from Real Brands but in a completely new form, as it should be in 2026).

## 4. Cash Machine

*   Thought-out Tokenomics.
*   Balanced mechanics of Token Burning and Farming.
*   Long-term development plan including an innovative model for the **Post-Farming Era** (when most emission (except Genesis NFTs 10 years farming) is mined, we ensure capital inflow into the system + keeping SNOVA in the system).
*   **Brand Invasion (Season 4):** The main event ensuring the system's value grows with every season.
