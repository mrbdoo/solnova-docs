# 🔮 Vision

We envision Neververse as a 3D world—a real world where other users and brands are visible in real-time.

**What exactly does this mean?**

1.  **3D World:** A real-time environment where you see others.
2.  **Game as Interaction:** The primary form of engagement.
3.  **Brands as Participants:** A brand is a participant in the system just like you. It can buy a Star from you (to build a representative office) or place its Portal on your planet (and pay you money for it).
4.  **WEB 3.0 + WEB 2.0 Symbiosis:** The best of both worlds.

## User - User Interaction

**Sharing as a Core Mechanic**
Satellites can only be dropped on someone else's planet. Therefore, whether maximum mining is activated at the planet level depends on whether someone drops a satellite there. By helping others, they will come and help you. Relationships and connections between strangers will naturally form.

<span><strong>CORE IDEA:</strong> For all participants in the system to earn more, everyone must fill each other's planets.</span>

**GIFs are the new Pokemon**
GIFs are rare. You can drop a Satellite only from the GIFs you have:
*   Ones uploaded by you to your Planets.
*   Ones dropped to your planet as a Satellite by others.
*   The GIFs of Planets YOU dropped satellites on.
*   **Gods of the Day:** First-time GODs of planets that became 100% bright.

You are collecting cool GIFs by leaving Satellites on Planets. At the same time, you act like a flower attracting Bees (other users) by showing up more cool and interesting GIFs.

## User - Brand Interaction

To ensure development, constant new value for the user, and capitalization inflow into the system, we developed a unique, truly seamless possibility for Business integration (from small companies to international corporations) into the platform.

**And this completely flipped the game.**
