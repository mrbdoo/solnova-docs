# 🔮 Vision

We envision Neververse as a 3D world—a real world where other users and brands are visible in real-time.

**What exactly does this mean?**

1.  **3D World:** A real-time environment where you see others.
2.  **Game as Interaction:** The primary form of engagement.
3.  **Brands as Participants:** A brand is a participant in the system just like you. It can buy a Star from you (to build a representative office) or place its Portal on your planet (and pay you money for it).
4.  **WEB 3.0 + WEB 2.0 Symbiosis:** The best of both worlds.

## User - User Interaction

**Sharing as a Core Mechanic**
Satellites can only be dropped on someone else's planet. Therefore, whether maximum mining is activated at the planet level depends on whether someone drops a satellite there. By helping others, they will come and help you. Relationships and connections between strangers will naturally form.

> **ℹ CORE IDEA:** For all participants in the system to earn more, everyone must fill each other's planets.

**GIFs are the new Pokemon**
GIFs are rare. You can drop a Satellite only from the GIFs you have:
*   Ones uploaded by you to your Planets.
*   Ones dropped to your planet as a Satellite by others.
*   The GIFs of Planets YOU dropped satellites on.
*   **Gods of the Day:** First-time GODs of planets that became 100% bright.

You are collecting cool GIFs by leaving Satellites on Planets. At the same time, you act like a flower attracting Bees (other users) by showing up more cool and interesting GIFs.

## User - Brand Interaction

To ensure development, constant new value for the user, and capitalization inflow into the system, we developed a unique, truly seamless possibility for Business integration (from small companies to international corporations) into the platform.

**And this completely flipped the game.**

## Big Picture

We believe that by creating a community-friendly and functionally rich real 3D world for User-Brand interaction, we can cover multiple innovative dimensions that transform how users, brands, and crypto investors interact.

### Endless Bizarre Creative Exhibition

With multiple ways of creative expression starting with GIFs and GODs and ending with Planet 3D Skins and Ship Customization, we create an immersive creative universe. Considering that we will give clear and handy ability to any user to create their own 2D and 3D Skin Packs, we will create a thriving creative whirlpool where many users will find ways to express creatively and experience the joy of having their own cozy and vivid world—bringing them the joy of owning, and external users the joy of gazing, interacting, and gaining perks.

### Innovative Bonus Lottery Platform

**Nugget Hunting Mechanics.** Each Nugget is hidden among the Planets' satellites—you can meet some here and some there and don't know exactly which ones are there (or you know exactly by following the map of all nuggets spread across the universe). You can visit them all, and each time you click on one, you participate in this Brand-created lottery. If 1,000 NFT-holders participate in this Campaign, it means 1,000 satellites across the Universe will be changed to win—like 10 or 100 or whatever number the Brand will set. Users can fly to them all, and each time (but only once per Satellite) they will have a chance to win a prize. If won, it will be actively shared.

### Couponators Possible Rehabilitation

Couponators were hyped around 20 years ago when they first popped up and quickly compromised themselves, becoming something highly unpremium and low-quality service-associated. Being in massive access, this fastly turned to the lowering of the service of discount providers and made the whole thing uninteresting to mass users.

Mixing with game mechanics (you must find/win/get the big discount) and manageable high demand (the big discount is Rare and thus still desirable and valuable perk), we can make a not-shitty platform for getting really valuable offers in a modern and engaging way.

### And Much More We Don't Even Know Yet

We know that this is just the tip of the iceberg, and real discoveries and breakthrough mechanics will naturally appear during the platform development. We, together with the community, will be choosing the most interesting and the most dopamine-packed ways of further development.
