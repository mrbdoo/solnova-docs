# 👾 Brands Invasion (Season 4)

**The Culmination of Neververse Development.**

In Season 4, "Aliens" from a parallel universe—**BRANDS**—invade the Neververse. This is not just an update; it is a revolution where Web 3.0 meets Web 2.0.

## The Vision
We have developed a unique, seamless way for businesses—from small startups to international corporations—to integrate into the platform.

**Core Idea:**
> Brands buy SNOVA to pay users = **SNOVA Capitalization Grows.**
> Brands pay SNOVA to remain in the system = **SNOVA Circulates & Deflates.**

## Brand Functionality: The "Invendor"
New entity type: **Brand Account**.

Brands can:
1.  **Own Stars:** Buy NFTs, brighten them to 100%, and set up "Flagship Stores" (Branded Stars).
2.  **Branded Portals:** Replace a standard GIF on a planet with a **Portal**.
3.  **Campaigns:** Launch interactive games and treasure hunts.

## Interaction Mechanics

### 1. Portals (The Gateways)
A Portal is an interactive object that replaces a GIF on a planet.
*   **The Experience:** Clicking a portal leads to a mini-game (e.g., Space Race), a contest, or an instant reward.
*   **The Reward:** Users play to win **Artifacts** (Real Prizes like iPhones, MacBooks) or Digital Prizes (SNOVA, Skins).
*   **Hosting:** Brands can place Portals on their own stars OR **rent planets from players**.
    *   *If a Brand rents your planet, they pay you SNOVA.*
    *   *If a winning player finds a prize on your planet, you might get a cut.*

### 2. Nuggets (The Treasure Hunt)
No games, just pure exploration.
*   **The Campaign:** A Brand hides 10 iPhones among the millions of Satellites in the universe.
*   **The Hunt:** Users participating in the campaign will see one of their active Satellites randomly start **Glowing**.
*   **The Lottery:** Clicking a glowing Satellite is a lottery ticket.
    *   *Odds:* e.g., 10 Prizes / 1000 Participants = 1/100 chance.
*   **Double Win:** If a prize is found on a Satellite orbiting *your* planet, **BOTH** the finder and the planet owner win.

## Campaign Types

| Campaign Type | Mechanics | Prize Structure | Host Reward |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Portal Game** | Skill-based mini-games (e.g., Space Race). | Top Leaderboard gets Real Prizes. | SNOVA for renting the planet. |

## Why This Changes Everything
For the first time, a game universe connects real-world value (Brand Marketing Budgets) with crypto-gaming mechanics in a way that is fun, not intrusive. Users don't watch ads; they *play* branded content to win *real* stuff.
